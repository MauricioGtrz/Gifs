# Gifs
When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.


When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.


Above every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

User has the option to creating their own button and from there click it and access its corresponding gifs.
